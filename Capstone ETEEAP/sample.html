  <br><h3>Purpose</h3>
  <p>   The Rizal Technological University (RTU), through its Institute of Flexible Learning and Digital Education, recognizes that not all learning takes place within the confines of traditional classroom environments, 
  and there is a pressing need to expand educational pathways for working professionals, mid-career learners, and other deserving individuals whose competencies have been developed through informal, non-formal, or experiential means..</p>
  <p>   By offering the Expanded Tertiary Education Equivalency and Accreditation Program (ETEEAP), which is governed by Commission on Higher Education Memorandum Order (CMO) No. 29, Series of 2021, 
  RTU can promote an inclusive model of education that validates these learners’ prior learning and grants them equitable access to recognized academic credentials. This initiative closely aligns with RTU’s mission to produce socially 
  responsible professionals prepared to meet the diverse demands of both local and global communities, as well as the University’s philosophy of nurturing the creative potential of Filipinos and upholding moral responsibility and sustainable development..</p>
  <p>  Moreover, it advances RTU’s mandate to deliver specialized, professional, and technology-driven instruction, strengthen partnerships with industry, and foster civic engagement. By implementing ETEEAP in full compliance with CHED regulations, 
  RTU stands as a forward-thinking, inclusive, and future-oriented institution that significantly contributes to the development of human capital and the realization of national educational goals.</p>
  
 
  <br><h3>About ETEEAP</h3>
  <p>The ETEEAP is a comprehensive educational assessment program at the tertiary level that recognizes, accredits and gives equivalencies to knowledge, skills, attitudes and values gained by individuals from relevant work. 
It is implemented through deputized higher education institutions that shall award the appropriate college degree.</p>
 <p> Beneficiaries must be Filipinos who are at least high school graduates. They must have worked for at least 5 years in the field or industry related to the academic program they are obtaining an equivalency. 
 They must also be able to show proof of proficiency, capability and thorough knowledge in the field applied for equivalency. </p>
  
  <br><h3>Benefits of ETEEAP</h3>
  <p>There are more than 10 million Filipinos working in almost all countries all over the world. Many of these were not able to complete their college or university degree while some have completed their undergraduate requirements,
  but as they continue to gain experiences in the field of their employment and have to take up or about to be assigned to supervisory positions, the issue of academic qualifications started to come up.</p>

<p>This requires them to go back to school or to take up additional training and courses to entitle them the needed credits that qualify them to higher job positions and promotions. Most countries and institutions require their 
employees to reach a certain academic level to be qualified in a job position. However, the experiences they had gained in their workplace throughout the years weigh much more than the qualifications of new graduates on a piece of paper in their hands as their only credentials.</p>

<p>This is the huge gap that needed to be filled up and the ETEEAP has been evolving to solve this problem. Thanks to all the institutions and people who 
continue to support this program. And many thanks to the Philippine government that spearheaded this system.</p>

  <br><h3>Benefits of ETEEAP</h3>
  
  <p>This expedited process is grounded in the recognition of prior learning and achievements. While students in conventional programs must fulfill every curricular requirement through the standard sequence of coursework and assessments, ETEEAP students leverage their verifiable professional experiences, 
  relevant knowledge and skills, previous education and training, as well as awards and achievements. These qualifications are systematically assessed and translated into corresponding academic credits through a Credit for Learning from Competencies and Skills (CLCS) mechanism. This approach values and formalizes prior learning, 
  thereby significantly reducing the time and effort needed to earn a recognized academic credential.</p>

<p>CLC is acronym for Classroom Learning Credits. The deputized institutions' Academic Review Board (ARB) or the equivalent determines the candidates' knowledge, skills, prior education, experience, awards and achievements relevant to a course or field under their academic programs which the students wish to enroll.</p>

<p>Consequently, CLC's can potentially be awarded for equivalent classroom, laboratory, or workshops normally taken up by regular students. Transfer credits for courses or subjects completed at other colleges or universities (if available) are also awarded using the ETEEAP. 
This unique program uses equivalent competency standards, a comprehensive assessment system and combined assessment methodologies to assess the student's experiences previous college level education and experience. Based upon this assessment, qualified students are awarded CLCs, which reduces the in-classroom time required for graduation.</p>
